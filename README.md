<h1>A simple social network with rails</h1>

## about the project

Despite the fact that I enjoy checking the news every morning, I've noticed that the security features that these applications provide to users aren't always the best. As a result of this, and the lack of things to do while listening to Eric Clapton, I decided to create this news site.

### built with

* [Ruby 3.0.0](https://www.ruby-lang.org/pt/)
* [Rails 6.1.4](https://rubyonrails.org/)
* [Postgresql](https://www.postgresql.org/)
